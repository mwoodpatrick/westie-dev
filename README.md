# WestieDev

This is my main mono rerepo and was created using [Nx][def25].

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [React][def6]
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/web`
- [Angular][def7]
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/angular`
- [Nest][def8]
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/nest`
- [Express][def9]
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/express`
- [Node][def10]
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins][def23] you could add.

Also see these [recipes][def24]

## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

 Run this generator to make a new library named is-even:

npx nx generate @nrwl/js:library is-even --publishable --importPath @myorg/is-even

This command:

Uses the @nrwl/js plugin's library generator to scaffold a new library named is-even.
The --publishable flag makes sure we also get a package.json generated and a publish target we can invoke to publish to NPM.
The --importPath allows us to define the name of the NPM package.

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@westie-dev/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to <http://localhost:4200/>. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

To build and test all my changes run:

- npx nx run-many --target=lint
- npx nx run-many --target=build
- npx nx run-many --target=test

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest][def21].

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `nx e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress][def22].

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Publish your packages

Publishing my packages to [npm/westie-dev](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/westie-dev/packages):

- cd dist/packages/lib/
- npm publish --access public

The '-access' option is only needed when first adding a new package.
